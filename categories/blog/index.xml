      <description>The reasons seems to be obvious, the new privacy policy.
Am I also part of the herd? Is it because everyone seems to be moving to it? Na I have been using signal for quite a time now but I mostly used it for saving notes to self, since nobody else seemed to use it. Even if you are trying it out just because Elon Musk tweeted &amp;ldquo;Use Signal&amp;rdquo; it&amp;rsquo;s fine, Signal is worth it.</description>

      <description>Backstory I was working on a project in go where I had to open and play around with too many files at once ( around 50 thousand ). The program ran fine when I was working with one file at a time. But when I tried to make it concurrent, I had an error saying Too many open files.
Now that&amp;rsquo;s weird cause my hardware wasn&amp;rsquo;t the bottleneck, I had enough free ram, my CPU wasn&amp;rsquo;t maxed out and I had plenty of empty storage.</description>

      <description>Softwares are a integral part of our lifestyle right now. Some of them are proprietary and some of them are not. The one&amp;rsquo;s which are not proprietary are generally associated with FOSS i.e. Free and Open Source Software. Let&amp;rsquo;s dig a bit deeper into the non proprietary world.
What is FOSS? FOSS i.e Free and Open Source Software, is any piece of software that is freely licenced to use,study,copy and modify and the source-code is openly shared so that people are encouraged to voluntarily contribute to it.</description>
