        <p>The reasons seems to be obvious, the new <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/?lang=en">privacy policy</a>.</p>
<p>Am I also part of the herd? Is it because everyone seems to be moving to it? Na I have been using signal for quite a time now but I mostly used it for saving notes to self, since nobody else seemed to use it. Even if you are trying it out just because Elon Musk tweeted &ldquo;Use Signal&rdquo; it&rsquo;s fine, Signal is worth it. But most of us are going to be stuck just &ldquo;trying it out&rdquo; instead of moving to it as a primary mode of communication. So I am taking a step further and deleting my WhatsApp account.</p>
<h2 id="i-have-been-using-whatsapp-and-i-am-too-reliant-on-it">I have been using WhatsApp and I am too reliant on it?</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s definitely hard to resist WhatsApp, though not impossible.&rdquo; - quoting from a conversation regarding this entire fiasco at OSDC. And I agree to it. By leaving WhatsApp I will forcing a lot of folks to contact me through various other means.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, I get it, but how to make the transition? How to convince my friends and family about it?</strong></p>
<p>The point being we didn&rsquo;t become reliant on WhatsApp overnight, it was a gradual process. People were sceptical about using it too back in it&rsquo;s early stages. You just do it yourself, this will force them to contact you in other ways :)</p>

<h2 id="why-do-i-care-about-privacy">Why do I care about privacy?</h2>
<p>You already do. Everyone has some expectation of privacy. We don&rsquo;t want to indiscriminately share every single aspect of our lives with everyone else. <strong>But I have nothing to hide . .</strong> If you wear clothes, use passwords, close doors, use envelopes, or sometimes speak softly, then you do have something to hide; you&rsquo;re just having trouble understanding that you already do care about privacy.</p>
<p>Excerpts from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/wiki/index#wiki_why_should_i_care_about_privacy.3F">r/privacy wiki</a>, Please go through it once you have the time, I will link it again at the end of the post.</p>
<h3 id="but-privacy-is-a-myth">But Privacy is a Myth</h3>
<p><strong>100% Privacy is definitely a myth.</strong> But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you will indiscriminately want to share everything. You need to be concerned in some way.</p>
<p><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Zr8Epa7Bgks/VXynWujAxII/AAAAAAACFIA/e6BRR4jSPn0/s1600/Mr%2BRobot%2Bseries%2Bpremiere%2Bbillboard.jpg#center" alt="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Zr8Epa7Bgks/VXynWujAxII/AAAAAAACFIA/e6BRR4jSPn0/s1600/Mr%2BRobot%2Bseries%2Bpremiere%2Bbillboard.jpg"></p>
<p>Managing one&rsquo;s privacy is a vast, complex, and never-ending project that does not scale; it becomes virtually impossible to do comprehensively but if WhatsApp has the audacity to blatantly announce that it will be selling your data, why can&rsquo;t we just leave it and let Facebook regret it cause <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/AntiFacebook/wiki/timeline">Facebook is straight up evil</a>.</p>
<h2 id="but-how-will-signal-sustain-what-if-signal-becomes-just-like-others">But how will Signal sustain? What if Signal becomes just like others?</h2>
<p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/2ocowp2ate561.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9de84c9bb6f41dc02944d86ddaad4126bc755b65#center" alt="https://preview.redd.it/2ocowp2ate561.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=9de84c9bb6f41dc02944d86ddaad4126bc755b65"></p>
<p>Signal is non-profit and open-source. Even if signal ends up selling somehow ( <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/kt91qk/signal_private_messenger_team_here_we_support_an/gikrk2p?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">which it claims it can not</a> ), someone will take the source code and just set up Signal 2.0. About it being sustainable, Wikipedia is the biggest example. It&rsquo;s been alive for 20 years, is non-profit, doesn&rsquo;t have advertisements and runs solely on donations. So I urge, if you are capable of donating, please donate to Signal - <a href="https://signal.org/donate/">https://signal.org/donate/</a> or any other FOSS product you are using depending on how much you value your privacy. Even a small donation makes a lot of difference to them.</p>

<h2 id="so-how-do-i-contact-you">So how do I contact you?</h2>
<p>I am available on most of the other platform, Signal would be the most convenient for you in my opinion or you can just go the old school way and SMS me :). If you are reading this and don&rsquo;t have my mobile number, I am also available on <a href="https://t.me/daemon1024">Telegram</a> and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@daemon1024:matrix.org">Matrix</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Try Signal, there&rsquo;s still time before Whatsapp implements it&rsquo;s new policy. Reflect on your online privacy in the mean time and make an informed decision on the same.</p>
